## 🌱 Inspiration
We were inspired by the lack of fun, accessible financial education tools for all age groups. From kids curious about coins to adults confused by crypto, we wanted to build something that makes learning money skills interactive, visual, and genuinely enjoyable.

## 💡 What it does
**FinFarm** is a gamified financial literacy platform where users explore themed worlds like **CryptoLand**, **BudgetVille**, and **GlobalTrade Zone**. Through quests, trading simulations, educational lessons, and progress tracking, players learn concepts like budgeting, blockchain, investing, world trade, and security.

## 🛠 How we built it
We built FinFarm as a responsive **web-based front-end** project using:
```html
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for structure and interactivity  
- Chart.js for financial graphs and portfolio visuals  
- Figma for design and theme consistency  
- Modular HTML pages for each theme-based world  
```

## 🚧 Challenges we ran into
- Designing a unified experience for **kids, teens, and adults**  
- Making sure each theme (like Crypto or Trade) felt **visually distinct**  
- Simulating **realistic crypto trades and price changes**  
- Balancing **gamification with educational accuracy**

## 🏆 Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Created **5 fully themed worlds**, each with custom UI and learning objectives  
- Built an interactive **trading simulator** with live portfolio updates  
- Designed an **XP-based quest system** for motivation  
- Maintained a fun, cohesive style across age groups

## 📚 What we learned
We learned that financial education must be:
- _Age-aware_: Kids need stories, adults need simulations  
- _Engaging_: Visuals and interactivity improve retention  
- _Modular_: Themed worlds make learning feel like an adventure  

## 🚀 What's next for FinFarm
- Add **multiplayer quiz battles** and leaderboards  
- Expand to **mobile version** for better access  
- Integrate with **real-world APIs** for live stock/crypto data  
- Offer **certifications** and track learning achievements
